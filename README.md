# HomeLabHub
## ! Many features here are not yet implemented ! see the [Kanban](https://github.com/users/HardoMX/projects/7/views/1) or look at the [issues](https://github.com/HardoMX/HomeLabHub/issues)

### What is HomeLabHub?
HomeLabHub is my own link- and info-dashboard, currently written in python with flask, but I might want to change it at a later date. 
I am mainly inspired by [Dashy](https://github.com/lissy93/dashy) and [CasaOS](https://casaos.io/).
#### Inspired by these projects, HomeLabHub has a few nice features:
- A clean, simple, and dynamic "glassmorphic" design
- Easy adding, editing, and deleting of links (called "cards")
- Your own backgroundand theme
- Settings and cards per user
- System and personal info (like weather, memory usage, current date and time)

### Who is HomeLabHub
Man, I don't knowðŸ¤·

### Why is HomeLabHub
I am mainly doing this for a school project, but will prabably continue developing it after the project is due.
